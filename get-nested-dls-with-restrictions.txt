This scrips is meant to find nested DLs under a parent DL (or set of parent DLs) and look at the accept and reject list to see if a potential sender of an email will get blocked when sending to it.

Example summary output:
Total users: 5767
Total groups: 1237

DLs to add user to accept list:
   dl-something10
   dl-something11
   dl-something15
   etc...

This helps greatly as in the example above when the parent DL has over 1000 nested DLs, it is virtually impossible to manually check those by hand.
